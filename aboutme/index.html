        <h2>Luis M Rosero</h2>       
        <p>I love programming, I made my hobby a way of making a living.</p>
        <p>
            I am married but I still do not have children. </p> 
            <p>I live in Colombia in a very cold area. </p> 
            <p>I like to study at BYU, even though my English is not very good. </p> 
            <p> I have learned a lot from the professors and I know their experience. </p> 
            <p>I play guitar and sing, a few years ago I wanted to be an artist but this is a frustrated dream but I'm not complaining since the programming has been much more fun.</p>
